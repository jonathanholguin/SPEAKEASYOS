Speakeasy OS is a terminal/command line based operating system intended to simulate a working OS with built-in features such as the ability to browse files, open files, create new files, delete files, as well as install and open applications. 

NOTICE: SPEAKEASY OS WAS CODED ON VISUAL STUDIO PRO
To run the program:

Add the main.cpp, authentication.cpp, and authentication.h to your project. Authentication.h contains the hardcoded username and password.
Running it successfully will allow the user to enter their credentials and if successful, will be met with an access granted screen. If not, the user will be required to enter the correct credentials.
